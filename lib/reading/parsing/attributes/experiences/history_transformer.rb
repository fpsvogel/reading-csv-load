# TODO Refactor! This entire file has become ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤® with the accumulation of new
# features in the History column.
#
# Goals of the refactor:
#   - if possible, avoid daily_spans; build spans with date ranges directly.
#   - validate spans at every step; that way the origin of bugs will be easier
#     to find, e.g. for the bug fixed in 6310639, spans became invalid in
#     #fix_open_ranges! and led to an error elsewhere that didn't give a trace
#     back to the origin.
#   - to facilitate the points above, create a class ExperienceBuilder to
#     contain much of the logic that is currently in this file.
